### Example Report Format

```
Subject: [SECURITY] SQL Injection vulnerability in query execution

Description:
The query execution endpoint does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for SQL injection attacks.

Impact:
An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries, access unauthorized data, or modify database contents.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Send a POST request to /api/v1/queries
2. Include malicious SQL in the query parameter
3. Observe unauthorized data access

Environment:
- BigQuery-Lite version: 0.1.0
- Operating System: Ubuntu 20.04
- Python version: 3.9.7

Proof of Concept:
[Include code or screenshots here]
```

#### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication (when enabled)
- API key management for programmatic access
- Role-based access control for schemas and tables
- Session management and timeout controls

#### Network Security
- HTTPS/TLS encryption for web traffic
- Secure WebSocket connections (WSS)
- Docker network isolation
- Configurable CORS policies

#### Data Protection
- Query timeout and resource limits
- Data access logging and audit trails
- Sensitive data detection and masking
- Secure storage of credentials and API keys

#### Infrastructure Security
- Docker container isolation
- Non-root user execution in containers
- Minimal container base images
- Regular dependency updates

### Security Best Practices for Users

#### Deployment Security
1. **Use HTTPS**: Always deploy with TLS/SSL certificates in production
2. **Network Isolation**: Run containers in isolated networks
3. **Access Controls**: Implement proper authentication and authorization
4. **Regular Updates**: Keep BigQuery-Lite and dependencies updated
5. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and monitoring for security events

#### Configuration Security
```yaml
# Example secure docker-compose.yml configurations
services:
  backend:
    environment:
      - SECURE_COOKIES=true
      - SESSION_TIMEOUT=3600
      - MAX_QUERY_TIMEOUT=300
      - ENABLE_AUDIT_LOGGING=true
    # Run as non-root user
    user: "1000:1000"
```

#### API Security
- Use strong API keys with limited scope
- Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Use parameterized queries when possible

#### Data Security
- Limit query access to necessary data only
- Implement data classification and access controls
- Regular security audits of queries and access patterns
- Secure backup and restore procedures

## Security Architecture

### Defense in Depth

BigQuery-Lite implements multiple layers of security:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    User Interface                       │

```

### Threat Model

#### Identified Threats

1. **SQL Injection**: Malicious SQL code execution
   - **Mitigation**: Query parsing, parameterized queries, input validation

2. **Unauthorized Data Access**: Access to sensitive data
   - **Mitigation**: Authentication, authorization, access controls

3. **Denial of Service**: Resource exhaustion attacks
   - **Mitigation**: Rate limiting, query timeouts, resource quotas

4. **Code Injection**: Arbitrary code execution
   - **Mitigation**: Input sanitization, sandboxed execution

5. **Data Exfiltration**: Unauthorized data export
   - **Mitigation**: Access logging, export controls, data classification

#### Security Controls

| Threat | Control | Implementation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| SQL Injection | Input Validation | Query parsing and sanitization |
| XSS | Output Encoding | React built-in XSS protection |
| CSRF | Token Validation | CSRF tokens in API requests |
| Session Hijacking | Secure Sessions | JWT with expiration, secure cookies |
